# Welcome to my project portfolio

### User Guide:

This webpage serves as a central hub to quikcly learn a little about me and to access some of the projects that I have built. Please feel free to scroll the work section and click on any projects that interest you. If you click on a project, you will be directed to the github pages. At the bottom you can find links to contact me such as a link to my gihub profile.

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point canâ€™t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.
